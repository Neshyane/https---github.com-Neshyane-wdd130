    <h2>Nesh</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Neshyane but most folks call me Nesh, I'm 22 years old and I'm from Dubai. I'm a Business Managment major but I'm taking a minor in Marketing along with a cluster in CIT hence why I'm in this class.</p>
   
    <p>My hobbies mainly include video games, working out, cars and content creation for the most part. I have a massive passion for cars so a lot of what I want to do in life revolves around the idea of one day owning my dream car which is a Lamborghini Aventador LP:700-4, I'm also a very social person and love meeting new people/making new friends so I'm very excited to study along side all of you for the semester!</p>

    <p>If there is anything else you would want to know about me or my family please do ask and if you would like to connect with me I'm usually very active on Instagram which is @Neshyane_Hydra, super excited to learning more about yall!</p>
